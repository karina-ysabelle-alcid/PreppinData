This repository contains my solutions to the Preppin' Data activities. Preppin' Data is a weekly data preparation challenge where participants are given a dataset and a set of requirements to transform and clean the data using tools like Tableau Prep, Alteryx, or SQL.

Each activity is contained in a separate folder and includes the original dataset, the expected output dataset, a README.md file describing the requirements, and my solution file(s) showcasing the steps taken to complete the activity.

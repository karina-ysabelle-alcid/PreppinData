# Preppin Data Activities with Python

This repository contains my solutions to the Preppin Data activities, completed using Python. [Preppin' Data](https://www.preppindata.com/) is a website that provides weekly data preparation challenges to help improve your data analysis and manipulation skills.

## About Preppin Data

Preppin Data offers a variety of real-world data challenges in a format similar to Tableau's "Makeover Monday" and Alteryx's "Weekly Challenge." Each week, a new dataset is provided along with a set of requirements and instructions. The goal is to transform and prepare the data to meet specific criteria.
